    <h3>
        Part 2
    </h3>

        This part is composed of 10 separate estimation tasks.
        In each task, you will estimate an unknown number x and will be paid according to the precision of your estimates as described below.
<br>
        <br>
<h4>
   Estimation Task
</h4>
        In each of the 10 tasks, a new number x will be generated by the computer.
        While all 10 estimation tasks have the same structure, they are fully independent from each other.
        This means that the numbers are not connected in any way across the tasks.
        You will receive information which will help you estimate x.
        <br>
        All other participants in the study are facing the same estimation task as you, except for 6 randomly chosen subjects.
        We will call these 6 subjects “senders”.
        The senders have already participated in a previous estimation task where they had to state their own estimates of number x for each of the 10 estimation tasks that you are also going to face.
        Hence, you and the senders are solving the same estimation task, but are given different information.
        You will observe the estimates of the 6 senders for each of the 10 estimation tasks.
        This means that, for each estimation task, you will have to rely only on the estimates of the senders for your own estimate of the number x.
        Hence, it is very important that you understand what the senders were asked to do and how they formed their estimates.
        <br>
        <br>

      These are the instructions shown to the senders:
      </div>
  <div class="card-body">
        In each of the 10 tasks, you will need to estimate a new number x. While all 10 estimation tasks have the same structure, they are fully independent from each other. This means that the numbers are not in any way connected across the tasks.
        You will never be informed of the exact number x. Instead, you will receive computer-generated information which will help you estimate x. For each task, you will see this information and then report your own estimate of x. We explain the computer-generated information and how it will be presented to you in the following.
        An algorithm will simulate devices which are also solving the same task as you. We will call these devices “estimation devices”. For each task, 5000 estimation devices will make their estimate of x. These estimation devices are independent from each other and their estimates are all of the same quality. The estimation devices are good at solving their task and have the following properties:

        <ul>
            <li>The estimate of a randomly drawn estimation device is more likely to be the correct number x than any other number.</li>
            <li>The further away one goes from the number x, the less likely it is that an estimating device will state that number.
                Numbers which are larger or smaller than x by 10 will never be stated.</li>
            <li>The average of the 5000 estimates corresponds exactly (or almost exactly) to number x, which means that the estimation devices are on average correct.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        Consider the following example.
        Imagine that the computer has drawn 280 as the actual number x.
        The following figure shows an example how often the 5000 estimation devices would give which estimate.
        <br>
        <br>
        <div style="margin: auto; width: 80%; height: auto">
        <img src="{{ static 'Distr.png' }}" style="height: 100%; width:100%"/>
            </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        As you can see, the estimate with the highest frequency is exactly 280, and the frequency decreases when going further away from 280.
        Thus, it is more likely that the estimate of a randomly drawn estimation device corresponds to the correct number x than any other number.
        Moreover, the further one moves away from 280, the less likely it is that the number is stated as the estimate, and numbers larger than 290 and smaller than 270 are never stated.
        Finally, the average of all 5000 estimates is exactly 280.
        <br>
        <br>
        To help you estimate the number x, the following procedure will be implemented.
        For each estimation task, one estimation device will be randomly drawn.
        You will observe the estimate of that estimation device.
        This means that for your own estimate, you will rely on the estimate of a single estimation device.
        To use the information from the estimation device in a best way, remember that the estimate of a randomly drawn estimation device is more likely to be the correct number x than any other number.
        Hence, in order to maximize your chances of correctly estimating x, you should report exactly the number stated by the estimation device for each estimation task.

        As you can see, the task of the sender was pretty straightforward, and they were incentivized to guess the correct x.
        The closer their guess was to x, the higher their chances were to getting an additional payment.
        Your task is also to guess the correct x, and identically as the senders, your chances of getting the additional payment will increase the closer your estimate is to number x.
        We describe the payment mechanism underneath.
        <br>
    <br>
    <h4>
        Payment
        </h4>
        If this part of the study (part 3) is chosen for payment, then 1 of the 10 estimation tasks will be randomly chosen, and you will be paid according to the precision of your estimate in that task.
        Since any task can determine your payment, you should take each task seriously.
        <br>
        The following rule will be used to determine your payment:
        The closer your estimate is to the number x, the higher the probability that you receive the bonus of Z Euros.
        <br>
        If your estimate is exactly equal to number x, you will get Z Euros for sure. The further away your estimate is from number x, the smaller the probability that you receive Z Euros.
        The payment rule is designed so that you can secure the largest chance of getting Z Euros by reporting your most accurate estimation of x.
        Below you can find a description of the technical details of the payment rule.
        <br>
        <br>
        The computer will draw a random number y between 0 and 100. Each number between 0 and 100 is equally likely to be drawn.
        You will receive Z euros if the quadratic distance between your estimate and the actual number is smaller or equal than y.
        Otherwise, you will receive 0 euros.
        This is the exact formula for the calculation of your payoff:
        <br>
         <ul>
          <li>Your payoff = Y, if (x - estimate)&#178; &#8924;y </li>
          <li>Your payoff = 0, if (x - estimate)&#178; &#62;y </li>
      </ul>

        Consider the following examples.
        Suppose the actual number x is 150 and a randomly drawn number y is 50.
        If your estimate is 130, the quadratic distance is (130-150)2= 400, which is larger than 50.
        This means you would earn 0 euros.
        If you estimate 145, the quadratic distance is (145-150)2= 25, which is smaller than 50.
        This means you would earn Z euros.
        If you estimate 155, the quadratic distance is (155-150)2= 25, which is larger than 50.
        This means you would earn Z euros.
        If you estimate 165, the quadratic distance is (165-150)2= 225 which is larger than 50.
        This means you would earn 0 euros.
        Notice that your chances of winning depend on the absolute distance from the actual number Z, so there is no difference if you underestimate or overestimate.
        The important thing is that your estimate is close enough to the actual number x.
        The closer it is, the higher your chances are of winning Z euros.
